Create a JSF web app that allows users to sign and view a guestbook.  
Use the Guestbook database to store guestbook entries.  
The Guestbook database has a single table, Messages, which has four columns: Date, Name, Email and Message. The database already contains a few sample entries.  
Create two Facelets pages and a managed bean.  
The index.xhtml page should show the Guestbook entries in tabular format and should provide a button to add an entry to the Guestbook. When the user clicks this button, display an addentry.xhtml page.  
Provide h:inputText elements for the user’s name and email address, an h:inputTextarea for the message and a Sign Guestbook button to submit the form.  
 
When the form is submitted, you should store in the Guestbook database a new entry containing the user’s input and the date of the entry.
